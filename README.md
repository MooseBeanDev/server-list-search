# server-list-search
Accesses an MDB to pull data regarding internal server names/ip address/primary admins responsible.

This was written specifically to query an internal access database where the IT Organization kept all of its server documentation (IP, description, purpose, primary admin responsible, etc.). Obviously that database isn't included in a public repository, so this mostly serves as a personal record should I ever need this C# project again.
